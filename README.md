# FAS-SpeakOut-2024
The competitionâ€™s challenge is directly focused on communication. Teams will describe and present a complicated technical process or issue, that is related to equity, in terms that the general public can understand. 

This competition will specifically focus on physical barriers. It is also an opportunity for students to collectively and collaboratively engage with SFU as a space and place, where they can communicate how technology leads to change, and also respond to their environment as an avenue to create the conditions for success for their peers and the wider campus community.
